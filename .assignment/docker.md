# Docker Project Image

Create a docker image that is capable of running the `battleship` game that we can use as part of, or to develop the application;

- Preferably use a docker image that is already available on Docker Hub;
- Try to streamline the layers of the image;
- Make sure the application is running both the static web server and the api for the game to work;
- (optional) make two versions of the image one with and one without static assets (so that they can be deployed to a different provider such as s3 or github pages);
- (optional) make sure the application is running on a different port than the one used by the static web server;
  - nginx
  - haproxy
  - apache
